      <description>We have a new site! One of Robin Donatello&amp;rsquo;s summer projects was to revamp the DSI website to have more flexibility in the content. Thanks to blogdown package by Yihui Xie, creating a custom professional website can be done relatively easily from the comfort of R Studio. He has a great tutorial/book on how to create websites with R Markdown.
Over the course of the next few weeks [edit: Months] all content from the previous site will be migrated over.</description>
