Annually, many Analysts around the globe report expending up to 80% of the effort and duration of an investigation in &amp;ldquo;wrangling&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tidying&amp;rdquo; data into a &amp;ldquo;shape&amp;rdquo; that enables thoughtful, economical analysis. Does this sound like one of your projects?
In this fast-paced Preparing Data for Analysis Workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn techniques to succeed with—as well as avoid-or remedy—important considerations affecting many datasets; such as:</description>
