      <description>Last week Chico State hosted it&amp;rsquo;s first Software Carpentry workshop and it was a great success. We were thrilled to have Reid Otsuji  from UC San Diego and a Library Carpentry instructor come up to help teach the material.
We had three undergraduate students help out as technical assistant roaming helpers throughout the workshop: Grant Esparza (Computer Science), Jerry Tucay (Applied Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics), and Eisley Adoremos (Statistics). Their assistance with answer questions and helping add to the collaborate class notes was invaluable!</description>

      <description>On August 13 - 15th, the DSI is hosting a Software Carpentry workshop for graduate students, faculty, and any other researcher that wants to learn how to conduct reproducible research. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.
The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what theyâ€™ve learned to their own work.</description>
