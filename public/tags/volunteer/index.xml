      <description>This year the CSU Chico Data Science Initiative will be hosting an ASA DataFest. This will be the first year Chico State has participated.
ASA DataFest is a data hackathon for undergraduate students, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and founded at UCLA, in 2011. A data analysis problem is presented in the form of a dataset and an associated challenge. Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings.</description>
