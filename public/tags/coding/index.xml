      <description>Last week Chico State hosted it&amp;rsquo;s first Software Carpentry workshop and it was a great success. We were thrilled to have Reid Otsuji  from UC San Diego and a Library Carpentry instructor come up to help teach the material.
We had three undergraduate students help out as technical assistant roaming helpers throughout the workshop: Grant Esparza (Computer Science), Jerry Tucay (Applied Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics), and Eisley Adoremos (Statistics). Their assistance with answer questions and helping add to the collaborate class notes was invaluable!</description>

      <description>The Data Science Initative and the Statistics Faculty are hosting &amp;ldquo;meet and analyze data&amp;rdquo;. This is simply a reserved space held in central locations for people working on code, data analysis, or some other form of Data Science to come, hang out, and code in proximity with other coders. Got a question? We&amp;rsquo;re right there. We may not be able to help directly, but we&amp;rsquo;ll try. At least we&amp;rsquo;ll help you get a good Google search going.</description>
