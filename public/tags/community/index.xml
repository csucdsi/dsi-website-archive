This year we&amp;rsquo;re expanding this event, registration is open to ALL undergraduates in the North State! As of 2-17-19 we we already have 22 students (about 5 teams) already registered!
More students means more funding is needed to keep everyone fed, caffinated and to provide excellent prizes to the winners.</description>
