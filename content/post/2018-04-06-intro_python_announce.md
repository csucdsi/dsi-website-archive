## Description

In this workshop, we'll explore Python and Jupyter notebooks as data analysis tools.  The basics of statistical analysis will be focused on Python's library Pandas.  With Pandas we'll learn how to import, filter, group, and summarize data.  Matplotlib is the preferred plotting tool of Python, and we'll combine Pandas with Matplotlib to make some simple but informative plots.  No Python experience is necessary, but a working Python environment is required -- one should be able to launch a Jupyter notebook on their own machine and install libraries using Pip.
