# Are Your Data Tidy? Or, untidy?
 
Before data can be modeled, analyzed or interpreted...

...data must be accessible in meaning-laden forms.
 
Annually, many Analysts around the globe report expending up to 80% of the effort and duration of an investigation in "wrangling" and "tidying" data into a "shape" that enables thoughtful, economical analysis. Does this sound like one of your projects?
 
## Data Science Initiative - Hands-on Workshop Series
 
As part of its _Hands-on Workshop Series_, the **Chico Data Science Initiative** is pleased to provide this practical and applied session. _Preparing Data for Analysis_ is designed to assist everyone that analyzes data succeed and avoid (and/or resolve) frustrating problems unfortunately inherent in many datasets.
 
The _Preparing Data for Analysis Workshop_ offers something for everyone...from the earliest of beginners to the most sophisticated Data Scientists. 
 
## Data Science Initiative: Learning, Doing and...Cookies!
 
In addition to a place in space and time where interesting people address and resolve challenging questions, the Data Science Initiative also has a reputation for three fabulous things:

* **Learning** (about data, modeling, analysis, interpretation, visualization, etc.);
* **Doing** (all the above plus mentoring and problem-resolution); and
* **Cookies** (considered self-evident).
