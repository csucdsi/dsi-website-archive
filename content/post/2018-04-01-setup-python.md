The DSI is hosting for our first workshop on Python! 

Grant Esparza from Computer Science will help us install Python 3 and the Jupyter Notebook, and get us started using Python. This 2-part workshop will follow-up in a week by Edward Roualdes showing us how to use and visualize data using Python. 

Python is one of the leading high-level Data Science programming languages. The power of Python combined with the literate programming tool Jupyter has been featured in a Nature article touting the benefits to scientific research.
