The Data Science Initative workshops and Community Coding sessions are in full swing for Fall! We secured the same time and place as last semester. 

> Tuesday & Thursday 2-3:50 Meriam Library (MLIB) 442 (4th floor, directly left out of elevators). 


**Workshops & Seminars**

* We will be reviewing suggestions from Spring and planning talks and workshops at all levels. 
* Do you have a request for a specialized workshop topic, or want to share your research or project? Contact us to start the discussion. 


**Community Coding Sessions**

* On days when no talks or workshops are scheduled the room will be open for Community Coding. 
* This open work session provides a helpful and friendly working environment where you can code, ask questions or discuss ideas related to R, Python, Data Science, or more generally data visualization and analysis. 
* We invite you to bring your Data Science and coding questions, data, and projects. Just need a place to work on stats/CS homework? You're invited too!
* On most days Edward Roualdes (STAT) or Robin Donatello (STAT) will be present. Other members of the DSI may drop in on occasion.
