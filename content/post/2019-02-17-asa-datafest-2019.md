We're doing it again! Last year the ASA DataFest at Chico State featured 12 undergraduate students in 3 teams of 4 people, a ton of food and a lot of fun. This year we're expanding this event, registration is open to ALL undergraduates in the North State! As of 2-17-19 we we already have 22 students (about 5 teams) already registered!

More students means more funding is needed to keep everyone fed, caffinated and to provide excellent prizes to the winners. Sponsorship opportunities are still available. Contact us for more information on how you can contribute. 

What is the ASA DataFest? 
 
ASA DataFest is a data hackathon for undergraduate students, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and founded at UCLA, in 2011. A data analysis problem is presented in the form of a dataset and an associated challenge.  Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings. After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.
 
Undergraduates from all majors are welcome. Some of the most diverse teams have been the most successful. 
 
A key feature of ASA DataFest is that it brings together the data science community. Undergraduate students do the work, but they are assisted by roving consultants who are graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals.
