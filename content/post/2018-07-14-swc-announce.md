description: 'A Software Carpentry Workshop'

On August 13 - 15th, the DSI is hosting a Software Carpentry workshop for graduate students, faculty, and any other researcher that wants to learn how to conduct reproducible research. **You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.**

The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. We're really excited about using the Software Carpentry curriculum here to help our researchers become more efficient in their research.

This workshop is focused on Reproducible Scientific research using R. The curriculum will include:

* Day 1: Monday August 13, 9am - 4:30 pm
    - Organizing data in spreadsheets
    - Getting started with R and Markdown
* Day 2: Tuesday August 14, 9am - 4:30 pm
    - Command line power: using the shell
    - Data visualization and manipulation
* Day 3: (optional) Wednesday August 13, 9am - 12 noon
    - Version control in R Studio using Projects
    - Building websites in R with Markdown
    

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible. For instance, after attending this workshop you will be able to:

* Use the unix shell to manage files without a graphical user interface.
* Import, process and visualize data sets in R Studio
* Create reproducible scientific documents that are human readable.
* (Optional) Build a website where you can share research, post course materials, or start an e-portfolio to demonstrate your work. 

Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. There is a small fee for this event to provide refreshments for participants throughout the two days. If you cannot afford this fee contact us to disucss options.
