## Description

Success in a data-driven world means empowering teams with science to improve decision making through confident, replicable and trainable programs that can engage an entire organization. Analytics teams that use a scientific approach to answer business questions will accelerate actionable insights and improve user experiences.

Peter and Martin will discuss their experience driving value in organizations including Lyft, Citrix, Alibaba and Bell where data science methods for growth and insights are at the forefront of the business. Data science is a team sport, the people in the business closest to the data often are in a position to know it best. Fostering an analytic mindset throughout the organization and training teams in a scientific approach to attack the problems they encounter will produce a needed competitive advantage.

Gain speed and agility in modeling solutions to the questions in your organization for a deeper understanding of the business landscape.
