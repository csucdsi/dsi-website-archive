We are very proud to share with you that starting Fall 2018 Chico State will offer an Undergraduate Certificate in Data Science! 

This certificate program jointly sponsored by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Department of Computer Science introduces students to data science by requiring a set of interdisciplinary classes: applied statistics classes, quantitative classes and computer science (programming and database) classes. 

The certificate is designed so that students will gain experience with skills such as inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data, unstructured data and; computational statistics; pattern recognition; data mining /predictive analytics; machine learning; data visualization; and programming. This certificate will complement a studentâ€™s academic major and prepare them for a career in which data analysis is required. 

This step indicates that Chico State recognizes that the academic and industry need for students trained in Data Science is an immediate one. This certificate is an intermediate outcome in a longer-term plan for building our campus' Data Science capacity. 

More information about the curriculum and program can be found under the [curriculum](../../../../page/courses/) page on this site. 

Fall enrollment starts soon, so keep an eye on this site for upcoming informational sessions and other fun workshops and research talks!
