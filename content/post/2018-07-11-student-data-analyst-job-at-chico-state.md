# Strategic Planning Student Assistant

* **Department:**  Office of the President, CSU, Chico

* **Project Details:** As one of the first steps in the strategic planning process, we are conducting both internal and external scans. The internal scan will review internal data (President’s Listening Tour, Campus Climate Survey, Alumni Attitude Survey, Spring Graduate Survey, etc.) to identify institutional strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The external (environmental) scan will examine patterns of change in the surrounding environment that will impact Chico State as an institution in the future. This includes a wide range of metrics at the global, national, state, and regional level, including economic factors, demographic factors, higher education trends, etc.
This is not a super hardcore data science position but will require a lot sifting through and visualizing data.
In addition to helping with the scans, the student (if they chose to remain with the project) would assist with the planning and execution of strategic planning campus engagement events, analysis of campus engagement data, and other tasks associated with the strategic planning process.

* **Time commitment:** This is a paid position open until filled. Summer hours up to 40hr/wk, and up to 20 hours (at least 15) during the semester if interested.

* **Requirements:** Applicants should have a basic grasp of statistical methods, a solid grasp of MS Excel and functions, data cleansing and formatting, graphing, etc. Experience with tools like Tableau or PowerBI would be a bonus. Applicants should have excellent written communication and organizational skills. Additional data cleaning skills with a programming language such as R or Python acceptible as long as the process is clearly documented and can be reproduced by other staff. 

* **Contact:** Students can apply on the [Handshake](https://app.joinhandshake.com/) job application website.

# Applied Statistics Research Assistant

* **Department:**  Joint research between Statistics & Chemistry

* **Project Details:** The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry is conducting a complete overhaul of how their General Chemistry (Chem 111) labs are run. This new setup is called Studio Labs and fully integrate lecture with lab, instead of having them as separate meeting times and activities. Research has shown that this type of active and engaged learning has a positive impact on student success and can lead to higher pass rates for this class. Using the new PHYS building as a catalyst, the department is making this change over the next three years. Pre and post surveys will be administered to assess the impact of this new lab implementation on faculty, staff and students. Surveys will be administered annually starting Fall 2018.

* **Time commitment:** 5-10 hours/wk for 3 units of research credit. The initial workflow setup starts Spring 2019.
