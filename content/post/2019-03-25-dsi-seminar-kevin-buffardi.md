## Description

Information is plentiful, but making sense of it is not always so easy. Graphical representation of data can help us discover new insights and communicate hidden meaning in complex data. In this talk, Dr. Kevin Buffardi (computer science) will introduce principles and challenges in visualizing information for better human understanding. Examples of good and bad practices will illustrate how to (and how NOT to) communicate effectively through Information Visualization. No prior experience in statistics or computer science is necessary -- all audiences welcome!
