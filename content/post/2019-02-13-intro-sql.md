## Description

You’ve got person level data (like country of origin) in one data set, annual data (like income) for each person across multiple years in another data set, but each person is on a team and team characteristics are on yet a THIRD data set. 
How do you link all this information together to gain any kind of insights? 
SQL is a powerful database language that can be used in it’s own program, but also inside many other programs like R, SAS and Python. Come learn the fundamentals of how to link information together across multiple tables, and how to create summary information using this powerful SQL language.
