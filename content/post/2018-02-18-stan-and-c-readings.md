Lately, I've been reading everything I can get my hands on surrounding [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), the probabilistic programming language.  A particularly awesome paper, written by Bob Carpenter et. al., discusses their efforts at [automatic differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07164). The paper mentions quite a few tricks of the trade surrounding the wide world of C++.  In the last week, I dove head first into these various C++ ideas.  I found them interesting, and I hope someone else will too.
