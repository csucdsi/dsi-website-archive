# We have a new site!

One of [Robin Donatello's](www.norcalbiostat.com) summer projects was to revamp the DSI website to have more flexibility in the content. Thanks to `blogdown` package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/), creating a custom professional website can be done relatively easily from the comfort of [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/). He has a great tutorial/book on how to [create websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). 

Over the course of the next few weeks [_edit: Months_] all content from the previous site will be migrated over. 

**Stay tuned for more information on our Fall events**
