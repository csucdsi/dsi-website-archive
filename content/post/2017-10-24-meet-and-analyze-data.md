The Data Science Initative and the Statistics Faculty are hosting "meet and analyze data". This is simply a reserved space held in central locations for people working on code, data analysis, or some other form of Data Science to come, hang out, and code in proximity with other coders. Got a question? We're right there. We may not be able to help directly, but we'll try. At least we'll help you get a good Google search going. Even if you don't need immediate help, or you just want a place outside the office to get some work done, the door is open to everyone. 

* Tue, 2-3:50 MLIB 442, Edward Roualdes
* Thu, 2-2:30 SSC 426,  Robin Donatello

Days/times subject to campus building closures during holidays and winter break.
