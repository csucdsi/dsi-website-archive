Do you want to increase your ability to read, understand, create and communicate data as information? To tell a better data story? 

Do you want to be a better consumer and curator of news, improving your ability to identify bull-oney stories that are only aimed to spread false information?

Are you concerned about ethics and fairness in algorithms that are used for decisions such as [whether or not you get that home mortgage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-016-3052-7), or that your resume is not tossed out without being seen due to a [bias in the screening algorithm](https://hbr.org/2016/12/hiring-algorithms-are-not-neutral). 

Or perhaps you want to add on some data-handling skills such as being able to obtain and process non-standard data such as text, images, and relational databases to improve your ability to analyze data in your current field of study. 

Employers are snapping up anyone who has technical skills related to data handling or analysis. Data Scientists have been and still are in very high demand in many fields such as Business Analytics, Genomic Analysis, Social Science, Healthcare and a multitude of Science fields that generate a lot of sensor data. 

> Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, visualizations, and creativity to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms from many locations. 

Chico State offers an Undergraduate Certificate in Data Science, a multitude of Data Science related courses, short courses, training workshops, seminar sessions and fun data challenge events such as DataFest (a 48 hour hackathon in April). All events are aimed to increase the data literacy of our entire campus community regardless of affiliation or major. 


Come hear about the new Data Science curriculum and programs and learn how you can get involved. 

_Light refreshments will be provided_
