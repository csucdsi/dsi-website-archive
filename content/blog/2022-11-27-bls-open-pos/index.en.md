Then consider applying to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Office of Survey Methods Research! We're hiring GS-12 or GS-13 Research Mathematical Statisticians to join the Mathematical Statistics Research Center, where we strive to improve the accuracy of BLS survey data and the estimates BLS publishes, where we aim to improve the efficiency of BLS data collection and estimation methods, and where we get to consult with economists, statisticians, and data scientists on emerging mathematical statistical issues to support all of BLS!

Tips for a successful application process:

* Provide transcripts that document the degree requirements listed in the Qualifications section of the announcement. If you think the transcripts are not self-explanatory, you can add a section for "relevant coursework" to the education section of your resume or CV highlighting the courses and credits that should count toward the requirement. Provide all relevant transcripts, not just your most recent one.
* Tailor your resume or CV to this vacancy announcement. Document your relevant work experience through bullet points in your resume or CV. Reflect the language used in the announcement where applicable (see Duties and Specialized Experience under Qualifications). For example, identify your methodological research, convey that it contributed to new or improved methods, and include how you disseminated your research findings. Resumes are first reviewed by non-technical human resources staff that determine whether you are minimally qualified by ensuring your resume corresponds to the requirements listed in the announcement.
* Your work experience bullet points should be tied to positions for which you list start and stop dates, using “MM/YYYY” format, for employment as well as hour-per-week. This is how human resources staff determine whether your cumulative experience meets the work threshold (see Specialized Experience under Qualifications).
* You do not have to limit your resume or CV to one or two pages. You can take as much room as you need (within reason) to convey your qualifications but be sure to proofread it before you submit your application.
