## What is the ASA DataFest?

ASA DataFest is a data hackathon for undergraduate students, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and founded at UCLA, in 2011. A data analysis problem is presented in the form of a dataset and an associated challenge. Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings. After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.

Undergraduates from all majors are welcome. Some of the most diverse teams have been the most successful.

This event is open to ALL undergraduates in the North State!

DataFest can be a lot of fun for several reasons:

-   Teamwork: DataFest encourages participants to work in teams, which can be a great way to meet new people, collaborate on a project, and learn from one another. Working in a team can also help break up the monotony of working on a project alone.
-   Real-world data: DataFest provides access to real-world data sets, which can be a fun challenge to work with. You'll get to explore and analyze data from a variety of fields, including social sciences, business, and more.
-   Creativity: Data analysis can be a creative process, and DataFest allows participants to think outside the box and explore new ideas. You'll have the opportunity to develop your own approach to data analysis and visualization, and present your findings in a unique and compelling way.
-   Competition: DataFest is a competition, and there's nothing like a little friendly competition to make things fun. You'll have the chance to compete against other teams in your region and across the country, and potentially win prizes for your work.

Overall, DataFest can be a fun and exciting way to develop your data analysis skills, work with real-world data, meet new people, and challenge yourself in a new way.
