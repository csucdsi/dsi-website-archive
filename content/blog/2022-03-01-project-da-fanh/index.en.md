## Two institutions partner to enhance the quality of undergraduate education for Hispanic students
                                  
CHICO, Calif.- California State University, Chico and California State University, San Bernardino campuses partnered to better the education of Hispanic undergraduate students in food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences domains (FANH). 

The primary goal of this project is to retain and graduate highly qualified students in the intersection of data science (DS) and analytics (DA) and the food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences domains. Project DA-FANH assists underserved students on both campuses and allows for increased representation in fields that are traditionally lacking in diversity. The program assists in training students how to use data to enhance the nationâ€™s professional and scientific workforce. 

Robin Donatello, project director, explained the value of the program. 

> "It showcases how data analytics is accessible to everyone, and it empowers students to learn how to be the boss of their own data and use it to make an impact in the societal areas they care about," Donatello said.

By incorporating culturally relevant education while modeling data science and analytics techniques in the FANH curriculum, this project dismantles barriers and existing stereotypes about who belongs, and it builds a career pathway for students of color in the intersection of data science and analytics and FANH careers. 

Project activities include career panels and job assistance to provide students access to career opportunities. The project also offers internship experiences that emphasize problem solving, data-driven decision-making and remote team-collaboration skills.

DA-FANH is directed by Robin Donatello (Chico State) and Essia Hamouda (Cal State San Bernardino) and is supported by many other influential and successful women, including specialty leads Stephanie Bianco and Christine Hererra. This partnership ignited a project that launched in August 2021 and was officially released February 21, 2022.

Faculty-led project directors encourage and ensure that DS/DA skills are a part of a curriculum that supports FANH programs. All news, activities and latest updates will be accessible through the project website, along with social media links and scholarship opportunities.
