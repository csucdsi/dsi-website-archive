Spring 19 semester is upon us and we're exicted to start up Community Coding again. 

* **Dates & Times**: Tuesday & Thursday - 2-4pm
* **Location** : Tehama (THMA) 116


## What is community coding? 

Students, staff, faculty, and the public are invited to join our Community Coding sessions. Bring your computer, coding projects, and your questions to this open working environment.

## What is this for credit option? 

Commit to studying 1 hr. per week for your (not necessarily CS) programming course and earn credit. Enroll in MATH 290-02 (5854), a 1 unit credit/no-credit course.  Credit is earned by attending at least 10 times.

The DSI Spring seminar series of talks and workshops will overlap with these hours. Approximately once per week we will have a guest speaker talk about some interesting Data Science topic or provide a hands-on workshop experience to learn a new tip or trick in R, Python, Tableau or some other program.
