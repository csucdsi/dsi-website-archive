## Description

This talk is about managing big data in a short amount of time, since there are certainly better solutions to managing big data with more time and/or money available.  Weâ€™ll briefly cover the constraints of the problem, limited memory and computing power.  These constraints will be explored from within R, but the same ideas carry over to any programming language.  The remainder of  the talk will be a hands on tutorial for managing a large data set.
