Last Spring 2022 our most recent cohort of Data Science certificate students took the Advanced Data Science course, MATH/CSCI 485. In addition to consulting with campus based partners to use data science tools to solve a business or programmatic need, students practiced writing for a public audience.

This fall we will be showcasing these students contributed blog posts, one a month starting in August. 

Topic were chosen by the students based on their interest and range from theoretical examinations of graph data structure, to reflections on justice in tech, and tutorials on SQL. 

We hope you enjoy these contributed posts!
