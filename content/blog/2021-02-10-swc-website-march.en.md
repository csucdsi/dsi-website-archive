Ever wish you had a way to showcase your work inside and out of the classroom? A place to share materials with students, or to blog about current research and developments in your field? 

On March 6th & 13th, 2021 the CSU Math Council is sponsoring a virtual professional development workshop for Mathematics & Statistics faculty across the CSU to learn how to build a professional website using Data Science tools such as GitHub and R Markdown. 

We will be using curated lesson materials from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. However, this will not be a standard [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop, we have purposefully chosen selected parts of Carpentry lessons to provide the necessary building blocks for a successful website. The curriculum will include:

* Using the Unix Shell
* Version control with git
* Very basic introduction to R (no real working with data)
* Creating reproducible documents using Markdown.
* Using all those tools to create a website

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower faculty to learn new tools to showcase their accomplishments. 

Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. Here is a link to the workshop webpage https://csucdsi.github.io/2021-03-06-csumath/ for more information and to sign up.

We hope to see you in March!
