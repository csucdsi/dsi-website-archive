As part of the Advanced Data Science, we explored how technology can perpetuate existing structures of discrimination through its design and application. As a part of this exploration, we read *Race After Technology* by Ruha Benjamin. As a person who may use data and algorithms to make decisions in the future it is important for me to understand how others experience these algorithims, and what should be done in light of the role technology. In this blog post I will introduce what the *Just Data Lab*  and how they are leveraging data and technology for justice

## What is the Just Data Lab?

Author of *Race After Technology*, Ruha Benjamin, founded the Ida B. Wells *Just Data Lab* at Princeton. The lab was named after late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries prominent journalist, activist, and researcher Ida B. Wells. [Click here for a brief biography of Ida B. Wells.](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/ida-b-wells-barnett) The goal of the lab is to "rethink and retool data for justice".
The lab addresses a variety of issues from revealing companies engaged in immigrant surveillance to developing strategies to aid formerly incarcerated small business owners. Additionally, the lab has a variety of tech and social justice initiatives. The lab has lots of cool projects! The Barred Business Project provides business grants to support the work of formerly incarcerated Black, Transgender, Queer, Native, and Disabled business owners. In order to further enhance the mission to help these groups, the team leveraged data to tell stories by creating an interactive map. [Here you can see the map.](https://pumagic.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=94fe8e1149b24b9a90c20dbef2ace3ea) They also provide a list of resources for community engagement. One I found particularly interesting was the Equitable Internet Initiative. This initiative seeks to increase internet access in underserved Detroit neighborhoods. One of the reasons I found this initiative particularly interesting was the emphasis on community engagement. The majority of the workers come from the neighborhoods they work in. This is just one of the initiatives the lab is a part of. 

## How can people get involved in this organization?

Checkout the *Just Data Lab’s* website. Here, the teams have worked hard, using the data and explaining the situation of many groups who are under-represented and may have different experiences than you. [Go to their website ](https://www.thejustdatalab.com/tools-1) and read up on some of the work they have done. This link will also show you more about other organizations that may be in the area or have options to get involved for those out of the area. (Note: You may have to scroll down for the page to load.) Educating yourself is another way to get involved. If you are interested in learning more about data ethic read Race After Technology and/or follow [the author of Race After Technology and founder of the Just Data Lab, Ruha Benjamin](https://twitter.com/ruha9?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) on Twitter.  

If you want to take it a step further and are a part of a community-based organization focused on social justice you can apply to partner with the lab! This is an incredible opportunity to access the resources of the lab to enhance your organization. [Checkout the logistics of applying here!](https://www.thejustdatalab.com/community-orgs)


## What is a tech justice issue in your own community that you and your neighbors could address?

One potential tech justice issue that could be addressed in the community, Chico State’s Campus, is mapping surveillance. The lab accentuates mapping due to the ease of understanding. There are likely surveillance technologies used in the community many are unaware of. To address this we could research the surveillance technologies used in our community. Then this information could be used to create a map for public use. It is important that the community is aware of the surveillance and the usage of the surveillance.
