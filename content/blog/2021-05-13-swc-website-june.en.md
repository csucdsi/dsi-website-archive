> This event has been postponed due to unforseen and unavoidable circumstances. We will be rescheduling this event for Summer. We are considering expanding the workshop an additional 2 days to include more lessons on R programming. Registered participants want a refund please email datascience@csuchico.edu. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Ever wish you had a way to showcase your work inside and out of the classroom? A place to share materials with students, or to blog about current research and developments in your field? 

On March 6th & 13th, 2021 the CSU Math Council is sponsoring a virtual professional development workshop for Mathematics & Statistics faculty across the CSU to learn how to build a professional website using Data Science tools such as GitHub and R Markdown. 

We will be using curated lesson materials from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what theyâ€™ve learned to their own work. However, this will not be a standard [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop, we have purposefully chosen selected parts of Carpentry lessons to provide the necessary building blocks for a successful website. The curriculum will include:

* Using the Unix Shell
* Version control with git
* Very basic introduction to R (no real working with data)
* Creating reproducible documents using Markdown.
* Using all those tools to create a website

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower faculty to learn new tools to showcase their accomplishments. 

Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. Here is a link to the workshop webpage https://csucdsi.github.io/2021-03-06-csumath/ for more information and to sign up.

We hope to see you in March!
